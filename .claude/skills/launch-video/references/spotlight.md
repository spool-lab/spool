# Spotlight focus

An SVG-mask overlay that dims everything outside 1–2 transparent "holes". An alternative to amber annotation rectangles for directing the eye.

## When to use spotlight vs amber rectangle

Both techniques live inside `.window` so the camera transform applies to them. Pick based on what you want the viewer to do:

| Goal | Use |
|---|---|
| "Look at this strip" (specific feature region, no ambiguity) | Amber rectangle (precise, geometric) |
| "Read this preview while also watching this control" | Dual spotlight (preview hole always bright, control hole retargets) |
| "Focus tightens as the click happens" | Spotlight retarget (single hole moves) |
| The amber outline keeps reading as "misaligned" no matter how you measure | Spotlight (soft falloff hides drift) |

Amber rectangles are unforgiving about pixel alignment — if your measured coords are 4px off, the outline reads as "wrong". Spotlight holes have a dim falloff around their edge that absorbs small drift; you can be ±10px and the eye still lands where you want it.

## The mask structure

A single SVG covers the window. Inside is a `<mask>` with a white "shows everything" rect and 1–2 black "punches a hole" rects. The output rectangle is filled with the dim colour and references the mask, so wherever the mask is black, the dim is *not* applied (those holes show the video underneath at full brightness).

```html
<svg id="spotlight" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none"
     style="position:absolute; inset:0; z-index:18; pointer-events:none; opacity:0">
  <defs>
    <mask id="spotlight-holes" maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100">
      <rect width="100" height="100" fill="white"/>
      <rect id="hole-primary"   x="50" y="50" width="0" height="0" rx="0.8" ry="0.8" fill="black"/>
      <rect id="hole-secondary" x="50" y="50" width="0" height="0" rx="0.8" ry="0.8" fill="black"/>
    </mask>
  </defs>
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#121210" fill-opacity="0.70" mask="url(#spotlight-holes)"/>
</svg>
```

Coordinates are in viewBox units 0–100 (percentages of the `.window`'s logical 1000×685 box). `preserveAspectRatio="none"` lets the percentages map directly to width/height without aspect-ratio distortion. `maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse"` is required — without it the mask uses object bounding box and you'll spend an afternoon wondering why your rects render at the wrong scale.

Each hole's default size is 0×0 (invisible). GSAP retargets them via `attr` tweens.

## GSAP helpers

These belong in the composition script next to `panelIn` / `clipCut`:

```js
const NULL_HOLE = { x: 50, y: 50, w: 0, h: 0 };

function setHole(sel, rect, at) {
  const r = rect || NULL_HOLE;
  tl.set(sel, { attr: { x: r.x, y: r.y, width: r.w, height: r.h } }, at);
}
function spotlightOn(primary, at, secondary) {
  setHole("#hole-primary",   primary,   at);
  setHole("#hole-secondary", secondary, at);
  tl.set("#spotlight", { opacity: 1 }, at);
}
function spotlightOff(at) {
  tl.set("#spotlight", { opacity: 0 }, at);
}
function spotlightSnap(primary, at, secondary) {
  // Retarget without changing the overall on/off state.
  setHole("#hole-primary",   primary,   at);
  setHole("#hole-secondary", secondary, at);
}
```

Define your focus rectangles once near the top of the script, in `% of .window`:

```js
const F = {
  sidebarShares: { x: 0.6,  y: 10.0, w: 20,   h: 3.4 },
  templates:     { x: 71.5, y: 11,   w: 26.5, h: 41 },
  editorPreview: { x: 1,    y: 1,    w: 68,   h: 98 },
  // ...
};
```

Then in scene code:

```js
spotlightOn(F.sidebarShares, 0.45);          // single, dim everything else
spotlightSnap(F.draftsGrid, 1.55);            // retarget, still on
spotlightSnap(F.editorPreview, 10.15, F.templates); // dual: preview + control
spotlightSnap(F.editorPreview, 30.15);        // collapse secondary, single again
spotlightOff(34.50);
```

## Hard snaps only — no morph

Spotlight retargets are `tl.set()`, never `tl.to()`. A morphing spotlight (interpolating x/y/w/h between rects over 200ms) reads as a "moving frame" — the eye tracks the motion and gets distracted from the underlying content change.

A snap, paired with a click happening 100–200ms later, reads as "the eye is already there waiting" — which is the whole point.

## Single vs dual hole

**Single** — for scenes where one region matters at a time:

- Sidebar click target
- Drafts grid contents
- A dropdown opening

**Dual** — for cause-and-effect scenes where two regions need to be readable at the same time:

- "User clicks Letter template, preview reflows" → primary = preview, secondary = template list
- "User toggles Privacy bulk, masked pills update" → primary = preview, secondary = privacy summary
- "User clicks Bone paper, preview restyles" → primary = preview, secondary = paper row

The convention: **primary = preview / result**, **secondary = control / cause**. The secondary retargets per click; the primary stays fixed on the preview throughout the scene.

## The payoff pattern

When the cause-and-effect has played its loop, collapse the secondary to `NULL_HOLE`. With the right side suddenly dim, the viewer's eye has only the preview to look at — and that's exactly when the preview's change is the payoff.

```js
// Scene 6 (Privacy): preview + privacy panel both bright, user toggles masks.
spotlightSnap(F.editorPreview, 25.65, F.privacyPanel);
// After the re-mask click, kill the secondary.
// Now the preview's redacted pills are the only thing lit.
spotlightSnap(F.editorPreview, 29.65);
```

This is a deliberate 0.5–1.0s moment of "look here, this is the answer." Particularly useful for features whose payoff is subtle (mask states, gap markers, accent shifts) and could get lost in a busy dual-spotlight frame.

## Measuring hole coordinates

Same workflow as amber rectangles, but with one advantage: spotlight is forgiving. If you measure roughly and the rect is 5–10px off, the dim falloff absorbs it. Don't sweat sub-pixel measurement — measure once to within ~1% and move on.

1. Extract a raw `.mov` frame where the target is fully visible.
2. Crop to the target region with `ffmpeg -i frame.png -vf "crop=W:H:X:Y" cropped.png`.
3. Measure the bounding box in source pixels (typically the captured `.mov` is 2160×1480 retina).
4. Convert to viewBox units: `x_vb = x_px / 21.6`, `y_vb = y_px / 14.8`, `w_vb = w_px / 21.6`, `h_vb = h_px / 14.8` (for a 1000×685 window).
5. Add 0.5–1% padding on each side so the bright zone has breathing room.

## clipCut interaction

`spotlightSnap` doesn't change which clip is visible — it just moves the holes. When a scene changes underlying clips (clip 3 → clip 4 etc.), the spotlight coords usually don't need to change since the layout is the same (right-panel controls in the same place, preview in the same place). Retarget only when the *active control* changes — Templates list → Paper row → Typeface row, etc.

Order of operations at scene boundaries:

```js
// Panel anchors first (0.4s lead — see composition.md on panel-leads-spotlight)
panelIn("#panel4", 14.85);
// Clip swaps next
clipCut("#clip-templates", "#clip-style", 14.65);
// Spotlight retargets last
spotlightSnap(F.editorPreview, 15.25, F.paperRow);
```

## Common pitfalls

- **The mask rect coords are in viewBox units, not CSS pixels.** If your hole is 220px wide on a 1000px-wide window, that's `w: 22`. Not `w: 220`.
- **`maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse"` is mandatory.** Without it the mask renders at object bounding box and you'll see no holes (or holes at 100× scale).
- **The dim fill colour and opacity together set the "how dark" feel.** `#121210` at `fill-opacity="0.70"` gives a strong dim that still lets shapes read through; `0.85` gets close to "obscured" which can feel too aggressive for steady-state scenes.
- **No border on the bright zone.** A coloured outline around the spotlight makes the holes feel like "frames" and any coordinate drift becomes glaring. The soft falloff at the alpha boundary is the whole point.

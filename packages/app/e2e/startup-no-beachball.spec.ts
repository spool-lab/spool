/**
 * Guard against main-process event-loop stalls on cold launch.
 *
 * A blocking call on the main-process JS thread (sync child_process,
 * sync big-file I/O, an unbroken JSON.parse on a huge blob) shows up
 * to the user as a beachball / spinning pinwheel within seconds of
 * opening the app. v0.4.17 shipped one such stall via the agent-binary
 * resolver — the perf branch that ships this test is the fix.
 *
 * The test does not enumerate offenders; it measures the symptom
 * directly via `node:perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay`, which is
 * already started in `main/index.ts` and surfaced through a
 * test-only global when `SPOOL_E2E_TEST=1`.
 *
 * Two thresholds, on purpose:
 *   - p99 < 200ms catches drift in the typical launch experience
 *   - max < 1000ms is the absolute beachball red line
 *
 * Both are intentionally permissive — CI runners are slow and GC
 * jitter is real. The point is to catch ≥1s stalls, not to police
 * micro-stutter.
 *
 * `launchApp` creates a fresh `SPOOL_HOME` per test, so the on-disk
 * binary-resolve cache is empty here. That is exactly the cold-cache
 * scenario where the regression manifests; with the cache populated
 * a regression in cachedResolve could go undetected. Keep this test
 * cold.

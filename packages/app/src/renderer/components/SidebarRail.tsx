// curve. Mixing the two made the topbar bg segment land ahead of the

 * Animated 240px ↔ 0 column that hosts the app's left navigation

 * during the fold — only the wrapper's width transitions.
 *
 * Used by both the top-level App shell and PageLayout (share editor).
 * Single source for the rail's timing keeps it in lock-step with
 * AppTopBar's bg sidebar segment, which paints the same surface
 * colour over the top of the chrome.

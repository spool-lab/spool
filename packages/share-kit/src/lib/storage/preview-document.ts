// Build the slim "preview" subset of a SpoolDocument that hosts cache
// alongside the full snapshot (e.g. share_drafts.preview_json). The
// preview is what a thumbnail grid renders without hydrating the full
// snapshot.
//
// Key invariant: the preview must render the same first N visible turns
// as the live editor would. Naïvely slicing `conversation.turns[0..6]`
// is wrong — when the user has excerpted via opts.selected (e.g. kept
// turns [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]), or when hideEmptyTurns drops tool-
// only assistant turns, the editor's "first 6" no longer match the
// original array's first 6. The template's `selectSegments` running
// over a naïvely-sliced array would find no matching indices and
// render empty.
//
// So we apply the same selection logic the templates use, take the
// first N kept turns, and clear opts.selected + opts.hideEmptyTurns
// on the resulting preview so the thumbnail's downstream
// selectSegments doesn't re-filter and re-empty the array.

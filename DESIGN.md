# Design System — Spool

## Product Context
- **What this is:** A local AI session library — an Electron macOS app that collects, organizes, and lets you revisit every Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini session you've ever had.
- **Who it's for:** Developers who think with AI daily and have accumulated hundreds of sessions across multiple tools. The persona is overwhelmed by the archive itself, not only by re-explaining context.
- **Space/industry:** Developer productivity / local-first tooling. Peers: Raycast, Spotlight, Obsidian, DevonThink — but none of them treat AI sessions as first-class library items.
- **Project type:** macOS Electron app — sidebar + main pane shell, the shape of a library client.
- **Core positioning:** "Your AI session library." The shell (sidebar of projects, main pane of sessions) is the home; ⌘K search is one of several entry points, not the front door.

## Aesthetic Direction
- **Direction:** Warm Index — library-warm, not terminal-cold. Function-first but with personality.
- **Decoration level:** Minimal. Typography and color warmth carry everything. No gradients, no decorative blobs.
- **Mood:** The feeling of finding something in a personal archive under a warm lamp. Intimate, fast, trustworthy. Not corporate, not clinical.
- **Differentiation:** Every competitor (Raycast, Alfred, DevonThink) uses cold grays or pure blacks. Spool's warm near-blacks and amber accent are a deliberate departure — the product deals with memory and personal thinking, and should feel accordingly.

## Layout Philosophy
- **Core principle:** Spool is an AI session library. The sidebar (projects) and main pane (sessions) are the home; search is one of several entry points, reachable via ⌘K.
- **Shell:** Persistent left sidebar (240px) + main pane. Sidebar lists projects derived from `project_groups_v` and is always visible across every main-pane state.
- **Sidebar:** Warm surface background, soft right border. Top-left wordmark `Spool.`, then a `PROJECTS` section label with a sort menu, then project rows. A divider separates derived projects from the always-last `Loose` entry.
- **Project row:** Display name on the left, faint source-color dots in the middle, monospace count on the right. Active row uses `surface2` background. Hover lifts to the same `surface2`.
- **Library home (default main pane):** Pinned section (collapsible, only when non-empty) above a recent-sessions feed bucketed by date. No centered hero, no global search box — entry to search is ⌘K or the top-right input on the results page.
- **Project view:** Recent feed of one project with sort menu (Recent / Oldest / Most messages / Title) and source filter chips. A `PINNED` segment surfaces project-pinned sessions on top.
- **Session detail:** Opens as a main-pane state (not a modal); sidebar stays. Action button row sits in the detail header.
- **Search overlay (⌘K):** Floats above the current main pane on a dimmed backdrop, scoped to `All` or the current project. Same overlay surface for Fast and AI modes.
- **Approach:** Library client. Window width ~960px to fit sidebar + main pane comfortably. Not a search utility, not a dashboard.
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned everywhere. No centered hero state in the shell — the centered ⌘K overlay is the only exception.
- **Max content width:** Main pane content stays at ~720px max for readability; sidebar fixed 240px.
- **Border radius:** 10px for cards / 8px for inputs / 6px for sidebar rows and buttons / 4px for badges. Pill (9999px) reserved for the ⌘K overlay search input and mode toggle.

## Typography
- **Logo/Display:** Geist Sans 700 — large, tight letter-spacing (−0.04em), the period after "Spool" in accent color.
- **UI / Body:** Geist Sans 400/500/600 — readable at 11–15px, developer-native, not overused. Do NOT use Inter, Roboto, or system-ui as primary.
- **Fragment content:** Geist Mono 400/500 — all indexed content (conversation fragments, URLs, code) rendered in monospace. This visually separates "Spool UI" from "your content."
- **Counts / paths:** Geist Mono with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- **Loading:** Google Fonts CDN: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Geist:wght@300;400;500;600;700&family=Geist+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap`

## Color
- **Approach:** Restrained — one amber accent, warm neutrals, color is rare and meaningful.

### Light Mode
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `--bg` | `#FAFAF8` | App background — warm off-white, never pure white |
| `--surface` | `#F4F4F0` | Cards, titlebar, status bar |
| `--surface2` | `#EEEEE9` | Hovered surfaces, mode pill background |
| `--border` | `#E8E8E2` | Dividers, card borders |

|-------|-----|-------|
| `--bg` | `#141410` | Warm near-black, never pure `#000` |
| `--surface` | `#1C1C18` | Cards, titlebar, status bar |

### Source Badge Colors
Each data source has a fixed color used consistently across badges, chips, and dots.

| Source | Light | Dark |
|--------|-------|------|
| Claude Code | `#6B5B8A` | `#9B8BBF` |
| Twitter / X | `#3A3A3A` | `#888880` |
| GitHub | `#555555` | `#999990` |
| YouTube | `#B22222` | `#D44444` |
| ChatGPT | `#10A37F` | `#20C38F` |
| Codex CLI | `#1A6B3C` | `#40C87A` |

### Semantic States
| State | Light | Dark |
|-------|-------|------|
| Success / synced | `#4ADE80` (dot) | same |
| Warning / stale | `#FBBF24` (dot) | same |
| Error / disconnected | `#F87171` (dot) | same |

## Spacing
- **Base unit:** 4px
- **Density:** Compact. This is a utility tool, not a document editor.
- **Scale:** 2 · 4 · 8 · 12 · 16 · 20 · 24 · 32 · 48
- **Result item padding:** 10px 20px
- **Search bar padding:** 12px 16px (home) / 7px 14px (results bar)
- **Section padding:** 20px 24px (panels)

## Motion
- **Approach:** Minimal-functional — only transitions that aid comprehension.
- **⌘K overlay open/close:** Backdrop fades in (120ms), overlay card scales from 0.98 → 1 + fades in (140ms ease-out). Reverse on close.
- **Main-pane state changes (Library Home ↔ Project View ↔ Session Detail):** Instant. No slide or crossfade — sidebar context already tells the user where they are.
- **Results appear:** Fade + translate-y(4px) → 0. Duration 150ms, ease-out, staggered 20ms per item.
- **Mode switch (Fast ↔ AI):** Overlay content area crossfade 200ms.
- **Hover states:** Background 80ms, border-color 80ms — fast enough to feel instant.
- **Nothing else moves.** No scroll-driven animations, no decorative motion.

## UI States

### Search (⌘K overlay)
- **Trigger:** Global ⌘K from any main-pane state. The top-right `Search…` button is the visual hint when a pointer user hasn't discovered the keystroke.
- **Overlay:** Centered card on dimmed backdrop, ~640px wide. Pill input at top, scope toggle (`All` / `[Project name]`) on the left, mode toggle on the right.
- **Mode toggle:** Pill-within-pill. Active mode gets `surface` bg + shadow. `⚡ Fast` | `🤖 AI` — replace emoji with vector icons in implementation.
- **Inline preview:** Top results render inside the overlay; pressing Enter commits to the full results page.
- **Results page (after commit):** Top-right input persists with the current query; results fill the main pane below. Sidebar remains visible.

### Result Items
- **Default:** No background, left-padded 20px.
- **Hovered:** `--surface` background.
- **Selected (keyboard):** `--accent-bg` background.
- **Action buttons:** Appear on hover/selection only (opacity 0 → 1). Primary action (Resume/Continue) uses accent border + color.

### Library Home (main pane default)
- Two stacked sections: `PINNED` (collapsible, only when non-empty) and `RECENT` (date-bucketed: Today / Yesterday / This week / This month / Older).
- Each row uses the same `SessionRow` component as Project View, so visual rhythm is consistent across surfaces.

### Project View
- Header: project display name + session count + sort menu + source filter chips.
- Body: optional `PINNED` segment, then sessions list under the active sort.
- Empty filter state: friendly message, not a 404.

### Pin Button
- Icon-only toggle on session rows and the detail header. Filled state uses `--accent`.
- A pinned session appears in its owning project's `PINNED` segment **and** in the global Library Home `PINNED` section.
- Replaces the older Star concept; star-prefixed code/UI was migrated wholesale.

### Sources Panel (Settings tab)
- Lists the three built-in agent sources with their session counts.
- Status: `auto` label + green dot when watcher is healthy.

### AI Answer Card
- Left border: 3px solid `--accent`. Background: `--accent-bg`.
- Header: `🤖 Claude says` label in accent + `via ACP · local · [agent-name]` chip on the right (always show "local" — this is a trust signal).
- CTA button: outline style with accent color, not filled — keeps hierarchy below the answer.
- Replace `🤖` emoji with vector icon in implementation.

### Status Bar
- Always visible, 30px height, `--surface` background.
- Left: colored dot (green/yellow/red) + synced item count + last sync time.
- Right: `Sources ⊕` button (replace `⊕` with vector icon).
- Dot is green when sync is healthy; yellow during active sync; red only on filesystem watcher errors.

## Icons
- **Library:** Lucide React (`lucide-react`) — consistent stroke weight, MIT licensed.
- **Search:** `Search` icon (Lucide)
- **Source indicators:** Replace all emoji placeholder icons with purpose-drawn SVGs or Lucide equivalents. Emoji are placeholders only in mockups.
- **Mode toggle:** Custom SVG — lightning bolt (⚡ Fast) and a minimal "brain" or sparkle (AI mode).
- **Settings:** `Settings2` (Lucide)
- **Status dots:** No icon — pure colored circle via CSS.
- **Stroke width:** 1.5px at 16px, 1.5px at 14px. Never bold/filled for UI chrome.

## AI Search (ACP Integration)
- Mode is toggled inside the ⌘K overlay — same input, different backend.
- Agent selector lives in the overlay (right of the mode toggle): `Claude Code ▾` — dropdown lists all ACP-connected agents.
- Status bar shows `🤖 ACP · [agent-name] · local` when AI mode is active. The word "local" is always present — it reinforces the trust proposition.
- AI answer renders above source fragments on the results page. Sources are always shown — the AI answer without evidence would undermine trust.
- "Continue in Claude Code →" CTA uses outline button style, opens a new Claude Code session with the synthesized answer + fragments as context.

## First-Person Language
All result metadata uses first-person framing. The product is about YOUR thinking.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "You discussed this · Mar 15" | "Claude Code · Mar 15" |
| "You saved this" | "Twitter bookmark" |
| "You starred this" | "GitHub · 3 days ago" |
| "You discussed this in ChatGPT" | "ChatGPT session" |

## Anti-patterns — Never Do
- Purple/violet gradients as accent
- 3-column feature grid with icons in colored circles
- Centered hero or search box anywhere in the shell — the library shell is left-aligned everywhere; the ⌘K overlay is the only centered surface
- Uniform bubbly border-radius on all elements (overlay search input is pill; buttons are 6px; badges are 4px)
- Gradient buttons
- Cold grays (`#0A0A0A`, `#111111`) — always use warm near-blacks
- Inter, Roboto, or system fonts as primary typeface
- Emoji in production UI — replace all with vector icons

## Decisions Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-27 | Warm amber accent `#C85A00` | Every competitor is cold gray/blue. Amber evokes memory, archive, warmth — fits "personal thinking" positioning. Unique in the category. |
| 2026-03-27 | Google-homepage idle state (centered logo + search) | The search box IS the product. Empty space creates gravity. Google proved this mental model works at scale. |
| 2026-03-27 | Geist Mono for fragment content | Visually separates "Spool UI chrome" from "your indexed content." Monospace signals: this is real data, not a label. |
| 2026-03-27 | Source chips below home search bar | Sources are first-class — not buried in settings. Chips show what's in your index at a glance and invite expansion. |
| 2026-03-27 | First-person result language ("You discussed this") | Differentiates from a generic log viewer. Makes the product feel like it knows you. |
| 2026-03-27 | "via ACP · local" label on AI answers | Trust signal — users need to see that inference is local, not routed to a cloud. Core to local-first positioning. |
| 2026-03-27 | Emoji as placeholder icons only | Emojis are fast to prototype with but inconsistent across platforms. All production icons must be vector (Lucide or custom SVG). |
| 2026-04-30 | Library-first shell replaces centered search home | Session counts grew into the hundreds across multiple agents. Users need to browse and organize, not only search. Sidebar/projects/sessions become the home; search retreats to ⌘K. Reverses the 2026-03-27 "search box is the product" decision. |
| 2026-04-30 | Pin replaces Star | Per-project pin-to-top with a global Library Home `PINNED` segment. Star UI removed wholesale; underlying data migrated. Pin reads as a library verb (where Star reads as a feed verb) and matches the new framing. |
| 2026-04-30 | ⌘K overlay for search | Overlay scopes to All or the current project and hosts both Fast and AI modes. Persistent top-right `Search…` button is the discoverability hint. |

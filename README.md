# Spool

Your local AI session library.

Spool collects every Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI session you've ever had into a sidebar of projects you can browse, pin, and revisit. Press ⌘K to search across the whole archive.

> **Early stage.** Spool is under active development — expect rough edges. Feedback, bug reports, and ideas are very welcome via [Issues](https://github.com/spool-lab/spool/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/aqeDxQUs5E).

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://spool.pro/install.sh | bash
```

macOS / Apple Silicon only. Or build from source:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
# DMG is in packages/app/dist/
```

## What it does

Spool turns the pile of AI sessions sitting on your disk into a browsable library.

- **Library shell** — sidebar of projects (derived from working-dir paths across agents) and a main pane that shows recent + pinned sessions for whatever you've selected
- **Session indexing** — watches Claude/Codex/Gemini session dirs in real time, including profile-based paths like `~/.claude-profiles/*/projects`, `~/.codex-profiles/*/sessions`, and Gemini's project temp dirs under `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats`
- **Pin** — keep important sessions on top of their project and on the global Library Home
- **⌘K search** — fast full-text search scoped to All or the current project; AI mode synthesizes answers across fragments
- **Agent search** — a `/spool` skill inside Claude Code (and any ACP agent) feeds matching fragments back into your conversation

Everything stays on your machine. Nothing leaves.

## Architecture

```
packages/
  app/      Electron macOS app (React + Vite + Tailwind)
  core/     Indexing engine (SQLite + FTS5)
  cli/      CLI interface (`spool search ...`)
  landing/  spool.pro website
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm exec electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3   # rebuild native modules for Electron
pnpm dev          # starts app in dev mode
pnpm test         # runs all tests
```

> **Note:** The `electron-rebuild` step is required whenever you run `pnpm install` or switch Node.js versions. Without it, the Electron app will crash at launch with a `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch error from `better-sqlite3`.

If you switch between **Node-side tests** and **Electron app/e2e runs**, rebuild `better-sqlite3` for the matching runtime:

```bash
pnpm run rebuild:native:node      # before @spool/core / Node-based tests
pnpm run rebuild:native:electron  # before launching the Electron app or e2e tests
```

## Release

```bash
./scripts/release.sh        # bump version, push tag, dispatch CI release workflow
```

Build + signing happen in GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`) so
releases are never tied to a local developer certificate. The script blocks
until CI finishes; artifacts appear on the release page when it returns.

To test a local build without cutting a release, use `pnpm --filter @spool/app build:mac`.
